## <span style="color:#ADD8E6"> Description </span>

In this lab, you will learn how to build a simple full stack web application using MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React.js, and Node.js) and you will build upon this application. Here's a brief overview of all the technologies you will explore in this lab.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, providing scalability and ease of development for applications with varied and evolving data structures.

### Express.js

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies the creation of robust APIs and web applications, offering a range of features for routing, middleware, and HTTP utility methods.

### React.js

React.js is a declarative and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the view as data changes. React Native is only a subset of React targeted toward building mobile/cross-platform applications as we saw in Lab 1.

### Node.js

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime built on the V8 engine, enabling the execution of JavaScript code on the server, facilitating the development of scalable and high-performance network applications.

## <span style="color:#ADD8E6"> Prerequisites </span>

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
   You can install from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. We will be using a local Mongo database, refer to this link to set up your database: https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/mongodb/setting-up-a-local-mongodb-database#setting-up-mongodb-on-windows
3. An IDE. We will use VS Code.
